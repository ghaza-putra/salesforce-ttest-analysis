## Backgorund Problem
Company X aims to improve its sales performance by conducting a training program for its sales team. To evaluate the effectiveness of this program, an analysis was performed on the transaction results from 25 salespeople who had undergone the training. By comparing the new average transaction to the historical average of $100, this project seeks to determine whether the training has a statistically significant impact on sales performance.

## Version Libraries
- Pandas version: 2.2.2
- Numpy version: 2.0.2
- SciPy version: 1.15.2

## Insight
1. **Measure of Central Tendency Analysis** :
The mean transaction value is 102.6, with both the median and mode around 100. This suggests that most transactions are centered around the value of 100.
2. **Measure of Variability Analysis** :
The data shows considerable variability, with a standard deviation of 31.18 and a range of 100. The quartiles indicate that most transactions fall between 85 and 120, though some transactions are outside this range.
3. **T-Test Result** :
The T-Test result indicates that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis (H0), meaning that there is no significant increase in the average transaction after the training, with a p-value of 0.41, which is greater than alpha 0.05.

## Advice
Since there is no significant evidence of improved transactions post-training, it is recommended to evaluate and refine the training methods used, or consider other factors that might have a greater impact on sales performance.
